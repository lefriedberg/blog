My name is Lily, and I'm a graduate student at Polimi. I forked this blog from my friend Rowan, in order to graduate from being a notes app philosopher to being a blog philosopher.

My interests include:
* Urbanism, land use, and ecology,
* Disability justice,
* Liberation theology,
* Politics and current events.

Rowan built this site using:
* [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/),
* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/),
* [Lightspeed](https://www.getzola.org/themes/lightspeed/).
