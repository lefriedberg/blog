# Book Review: The One Straw Revolution by Fukuoka Masanobu

Trying to sort the wheat from the chaff on organic and regenerative farming--or really sustainable business practices of any kind--is extremely difficult. Even truly restorative practices can serve the role of greenwashing when they obscure the fact that, often, [decreased consumption is the only way](https://drawdown.org/insights/greenwashing-and-denial-wont-solve-beefs-enormous-climate-problems). Fukuoka Masanobu's _The One Straw Revolution_ envisions a world where farming, food consumption, and politics change as a result of philosophical and spiritual change.

As a secular, Western, 21st century person, I find this kind of thing implausible. But, when I think about it, I also find implausible [every other alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism) to widespread destruction and climate chaos. And historically, religion seems to have some ability to change society. So, you never know.


## Fukuoka's Natural Farming



Fukuoka begins by introducing the four principles of natural farming, namely:

1. NO CULTIVATION, that is, no plowing or turning of the soil.
2. NO CHEMICAL FERTILIZER OR PREPARED COMPOST.
3. NO WEEDING BY TILLAGE OR HERBICIDES.
4. NO DEPENDENCE ON CHEMICALS.



We then get into a pretty weedy (from my citified perspective) description of the annual cycle of production on his farm, in Ehime prefecture in southern Japan. Having a passing familiarity with some of the basic concepts of regenerative and no-till farming, there are plenty of familiar aspects to the method. 


this is similar to modern concepts in regenerative, no-till, and organic pharmacy

scientifically those applications are not demonstrated in the text, but lots of people have done other work on this elsewhere. address the yield thing here

this philosophy is a response to "scientific" or "chemical" agriculture (which is very obviously part of a problem)

No-till farming seems to be increasingly widely
accepted, and 

polyculture, permaculture, regenerative farming


furthermore, I did not independently verify 
his claims about his actual crop yields, although
I also didn't find any allegations that those
claims are fraudulent


sticking point (to me): the malthusian argument basically.

his response: the food mandala basically. he's a degrowther too. this is where the spiritual arguments of the book are pretty central. the policy wonks (aka liberals) of the world who think progress will magically solve all problems without anyone having to change their lifestyles are just obviously deluded. Probably expecting change is also deluded but at least it's not _physically_ impossible.


it's interesting and admirable that he's not mad about the highway...


## criticisms of the book aka why do we need zen buddhism

1. pseudoscience and anti-science stance
2. internal contradictions and hypocrisy
3. nature fallacy
4. if it's so good, why aren't we already doing it?

pseudoscientific claims 
note about chemicals (aka what i would call
[environmental contaminants](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/13/a-chemical-hunger-part-iii-environmental-contaminants/)):

From the introduction by Wendell Berry:

> What he fears in modern applied science is
    its disdain for mystery, its willingness to reduce life ot what is known about it and _to act on the assumption that what it does not know can be safely ignored._

temptation of scientists is to do a no true scotsman about this. ethnobotany example.

internal contradictions/outright hypocrisy


Nature fallacy/why do you need the woo stuff anyway

the actually false stuff in the book is mostly irrelevant so im going to ignore it

hypocrisy (as with machine oil on the trees, chicken shit in the yard)
    it's an iterative process idk

throughout the entire book it is essentially a given that getting close to nature is the desired goal. on the face of things this is a straightforward application of the nature fallacy. I think critics will want to dismiss the entire book because this is the core of it. I think if you're a hardcore utilitarian you can simply ignore the spiritual aspects of this book

but i think the way he's using nature, he might as well be talking about god. he's talking about the purpose of human life, the meaning of the good life.

If you're only interested in organic farming, you can safely stop reading here. 

4. why 

economic treadmill of scientification (capitalism and colonialism!! see graeber and james c scott)

## The One-Straw Revolution


> At that time I addressed everyone as follows, "On this side is the wharf. On the other side is Pier 4. If you think there is life on this side, then death is on the other. If you want to get rid fo the idea of death, then you should rid yourself of the notion that there is life on this side. Life and death are one."
> 
> When I said this everyone became even more concerned about me.


relativism is wrong because judgement itself is wrong

The revolution is about laying straw on your fields. It is about improving the soil. It is about a world in which farmers have the time to be philosophers and poets. It is about adopting a diet and lifestyle that are healthy for human beings and the ecosystems in which they live.


But it's also about a radically different approach to knowledge and the world. "true solutions" radical humility etc

the emptiness of all teachings




Leaving science 


Yield
> "Wouldn't the yield be greater if you used fertilizer or pesticide in certain cases or at certain times?" There are always those who try to mix natural and scientific farming. But this way of thinking completely misses the point. The farmer who moves toward compromise can no longer criticize science at the fundamental level.

This is interesting because he does compromise. It sounds absolutist and hypocritical.

Frogs
> Methods of insect control which ignore the relationships among the insects themselves are truly useless. Research on spiders and leaf-hoppers must also consider the relation between frogs and spiders. When things have reached this point, a frog professor will also be needed.

Philosophy and praxis

> Before researchers become researchers they should first become philosophers. They should consider what the human goal is, what it is that humanity should create...

>In applying my theories to farming, I have been experimenting in growing my crops in various ways, always with the idea of developing a method close to nature. I have done this by whittling away unnecessary agricultural practices.


land use?

> Looking at the winter fields, the appearance of which has completely changed in ten years, I feel an anger I cannot express.
